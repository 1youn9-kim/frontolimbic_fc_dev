Frontolimbic Functional Connectivity Development from Birth to Emerging Adulthood

Code is organized sequentially: Alphabets mark scripts for different parts of the study, and numbers mark the order in which the code need to be executed.
In general the later scripts are dependent on files created from earlier scripts (e.g., A_1 execution required for almost all following scripts).

Main datasets include the Human Connectome Project - Young Adult (HCP-YA), Human Connectome Project - Development (HCP-D), and Baby Connectome Project (BCP). Data for supplementary analyses include the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC).
The HCP-YA dataset is publicly available through ConnectomeDB through an access request (https://db.humanconnectome.org).
The BCP dataset and the HCP-D dataset can be accessed by submitting data access requests to the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/lifespan-baby-connectome-project, https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-lifespan-development/data-releases).
The PNC dataset is also available through a data access request (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000607.v3.p2).

HCP-YA and HCP-D is distributed in minimally pre-processed format, while BCP and PNC are distributed in raw format and must be pre-processed.
